!!! warning "Choose Carefully"
    Your selection determines your membership tasks. You can reset later, but any progress will be lost.

## What Happens Next

After selection:

1. **A personal lane is created** with your name (e.g., "John's Tasks")
2. **Two task cards are added**:
   - Your selected activity task (e.g., "Open Radiona - 10x required")
   - "Pay Membership Fee" task
3. **You're taken to the board** to see your tasks

## Task Card Format

Your activity task card includes:

```markdown
# Open Radiona - 10x required

Complete this activity 10 times during your membership.

**Progress:** 0 / 10 completed

[tag:Membership]

```

The progress tracker helps you and moderators see how you're doing.

## The Membership Fee Task

Everyone also gets a "Pay Membership Fee" card:

```markdown
# Pay Membership Fee

Pay the annual membership fee to complete your membership requirements.

[tag:Membership]
[owner:you@email.com]
```

Mark this as done by moving it to a "Done" lane after payment.

## Visual Feedback
