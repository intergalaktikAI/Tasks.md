# Reset Selection

If you've chosen the wrong activity or want to start fresh, you can reset your selection.

## When to Reset

Consider resetting if:

- You chose an activity you can't complete
- Your circumstances have changed
- You want to try a different contribution type

!!! danger "Warning: Data Loss"
    Resetting deletes your existing membership task cards and erases all progress. This cannot be undone.

## How to Reset

### Step 1: Locate the Reset Button

The **Reset Selection** button appears in the header, next to the logout button.

!!! note "Button Visibility"
    The reset button only appears if you've already selected an activity.

### Step 2: Click Reset Selection

Click the "Reset Selection" button in the header.

### Step 3: Confirm Reset

A confirmation dialog appears:

> **Reset Activity Selection?**
>
> This will delete your existing membership tasks and let you choose a new activity. Your progress will be lost.
>
> [Cancel] [Reset]

### Step 4: Confirm or Cancel

- **Cancel**: Return to the board, nothing changes
- **Reset**: Proceed with reset

## What Happens on Reset

When you confirm the reset:

1. **Your membership cards are deleted**
   - Activity task card (e.g., "Open Radiona - 10x required")
   - "Pay Membership Fee" card

2. **Your profile is reset**
   - Activity choice cleared
   - Progress reset to 0
   - First login flag reset

3. **Activity selection modal appears**
   - You'll see the three options again
   - Choose a new activity
   - New cards are created

## After Resetting

After selecting a new activity:

1. Fresh task cards are created
2. Progress starts at 0
3. A new lane may be created if needed

## Important Notes

### Progress is Lost

Your previous progress count is permanently erased. If you had completed 5/10 "Open Radiona" sessions, that count is gone.

### Cards are Deleted

Your membership task cards are permanently deleted from the file system. The content cannot be recovered.

### Lane May Remain

Your personal lane (e.g., "John's Tasks") remains but will be empty after reset. New cards will be added to it.

### Other Cards Safe

Only membership-related cards are deleted. Any other cards you created remain untouched.

## Use Cases

### Changing Life Circumstances

> "I chose 'Open Radiona' but my work schedule changed and I can't host sessions anymore."

Reset and select "Create Art Work" which you can do on your own time.

### Realizing Better Fit

> "I chose 'Organise Meetup' but realized I'd rather contribute more frequently with less planning."

Reset and select "Open Radiona" for more frequent, simpler contributions.

### Starting Fresh

> "I made my selection months ago but haven't tracked anything. I want to start properly."

Reset to clear any confusion and begin with accurate tracking.

## FAQ

### Can I reset multiple times?

Yes, there's no limit on how many times you can reset. However, each reset erases all progress.

### Will moderators know I reset?

The system doesn't track reset history. Your profile simply shows your current selection.

### What if I accidentally reset?

Unfortunately, there's no undo. You'll need to select a new activity and start from 0.

### Can moderators reset for me?

Moderators can manually edit profile files, but the UI reset is self-service only.

## Alternatives to Reset

Before resetting, consider:

### Talk to a Moderator

Maybe your progress can be manually adjusted without losing everything.

### Complete Current Activity

If you're close to completion, it might be easier to finish what you started.

### Wait It Out

Membership periods renew. Your next period could start fresh automatically.
